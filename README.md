This is the conflicts projects - A
This is the first local insertion - B

This is the second remote insertion - D
This is the third local insertion - E
This is the third remote insertion - E (*leaving this as an example)

Now, I will try to solve conflicts using RStudio Git options instead of Git command in the console

This is remote insertion AA

This is the first local insertion BB to create conflict with remote BB

This is the second remote BB (not in local repository to create conflict) - Also differences in formatting.
